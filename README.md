# Phonebook
This is a demo application for how to dockerize application.

This is a Spring Boot based REST application written in Kotlin - a phone register stores person's first name, last name, and phone number.

## Modules

The application has 5 modules:
- `phonebook-dao`: defines the Data Access Layer for the database.
- `phonebook-service`: defines the business logic. A bridge between DAO and the WEB module.
- `phonebook-web`: contains the REST controllers.
- `phonebook-application`: contains the main method (the entry point for the application).
- `release`: contains `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for dockerization.

## Branches
The repo has 3 branches:
- `master`: contains the base phonebook application without dockerization. The application uses H2 database.
- `dockerize-1-h2`: creates a single docker image for the application. The application uses H2 database. 
- `dockerize-2-mysql`:  creates docker images for multiple services. The application uses MySQL database and persist the database.

## How to build the project

You can use maven command:
```text
mvn clean install
```

## Run the application

Note: When application is running locally it uses H2 in memory database.

There are several ways to run the application
1. With IDE: you can use IDE build in run support. Find the `com.demo.phonebook.PhonebookApplication` class and run the `main` method with IDE.
2. Run with JDK: after bou built the application with maven, you cen run it with JDK:
```text
java -jar phonebook-application/target/phonebook-exec.jar
```

## Run the application in Docker

Note: When application is running in Docker it uses MySQL database and it will persist data.

You can run the phonebook application with docker-compose:
```text
docker-compose -f release/src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

### Check running docker containers 
You can check your running container with `docker ps` command:
```text
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE              COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
4bd627c86531   phonebook:latest   "java -jar phonebookâ€¦"   17 seconds ago   Up 16 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   phonebook_application
```
### Stop and remove docker container

You can stop the application
```text
docker container stop phonebook_application
```
You can remove the container:
```text
docker container rm phonebook_application
```

## Use the application
After you started the application you can find the `swagger-ui` in your favorite browser to reach REST endpoints:
```text
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```
